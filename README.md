The `sparrow` is an infrastructure monitoring tool. The binary includes several checks (e.g. health check) that will be executed periodically.

## About this component

The `sparrow` performs several checks to monitor the health of the infrastructure and network from its point of view. The following checks are available:

1. Health check - `health`: The `sparrow` is able perform an http-based (HTTP/1.1) health check to provided endpoints. The `sparrow` will expose its own health check endpoint as well.

2. Latency check - `rtt`: The `sparrow` is able to communicate with other `sparrow` instances to calculate the time a request takes to the target and back. The check is http (HTTP/1.1) based as well.

## Installation

The `sparrow` is provided as an small binary & a container image.

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases) for to get the latest version.

### Binary

The binary is available for several distributions. Currently the binary needs to be installed from a provided bundle or source.

```sh
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v${RELEASE_VERSION}/sparrow_${RELEASE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz -Lo sparrow.tar.gz
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v${RELEASE_VERSION}/sparrow_${RELEASE_VERSION}_checksums.txt -Lo checksums.txt
```

For example release `v0.0.1`:
```sh
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v0.0.1/sparrow_0.0.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz -Lo sparrow.tar.gz
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v0.0.1/sparrow_0.0.1_checksums.txt -Lo checksums.txt
```

Extract the binary:
```sh
tar -xf sparrow.tar.gz
```

### Container Image

The [sparrow container images](https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/pkgs/container/sparrow) for dedicated [release](https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases) can be found in the GitHub registry.

### Helm

## Usage

Use `sparrow run` to execute the instance using the binary.

### Container Image

Run a `sparrow` container by using e.g. `docker run ghcr.io/y-eight/sparrow`.

Pass the available configuration arguments to the container e.g. `docker run ghcr.io/y-eight/sparrow --help`.

Start the instance using a mounted startup configuration file e.g. `docker run -v /config:/config  ghcr.io/y-eight/sparrow --config /config/config.yaml`.

## Configuration

The configuration is divided into two parts. The startup configuration and the runtime configuration. The startup configuration is a technical configuration to configure the `sparrow` instance itself. The runtime configuration will be loaded by the `loader` from a remote endpoint. This configuration consist of the checks configuration.

### Startup

The available configuration options can found in the [CLI flag documentation](docs/sparrow.md).

The `sparrow` is able to get the startup configuration from different sources as follows.

Priority of configuration (high to low):

1. CLI flags
2. Environment variables 
3. Defined configuration file
4. Default configuration file

#### Loader

The loader component of the `sparrow` will load the [Runtime](#runtime) configuration dynamically.

The loader can be selected by specifying the `loaderType` configuration parameter.

The default loader is an `http` loader that is able to get the runtime configuration from a remote endpoint.

Available loader:
- `http`: The default. Loads configuration from a remote endpoint. Token authentication is available. Additional configuration parameter have the prefix `loaderHttp`.
- `file` (experimental): Loads configuration once from a local file. Additional configuration parameter have the prefix `loaderFile`. This is just for development purposes.

### Runtime

Besides the technical startup configuration the configuration for the `sparrow` checks is loaded dynamically from an http endpoint. The `loader` is able to load the configuration dynamically during the runtime. Checks can be enabled, disabled and configured. The available loader confutation options for the startup configuration can be found in [here](sparrow_run.md)

Example format of a runtime configuration:

```YAML
apiVersion: 0.0.1
kind: Config
checks:
  health:
    enabled: true
```

### Check: Health

Available configuration options:

- `checks.health.enabled` (boolean): Currently not used.
- `checks.health.targets` (list of strings): List of targets to send health probe. Needs to be a valid url. Can be another `sparrow` instance. Use health endpoint, e.g. `https://sparrow-dns.telekom.de/checks/health`. The remote `sparrow` instance needs the `healthEndpoint` enabled.
- `checks.health.healthEndpoint` (boolean): Needs to be activated when the `sparrow` should expose its own health endpoint. Mandatory if another `sparrow` instance wants perform a health check.

Example configuration:

```YAML
checks:
  health:
    enabled: true
    targets:
      - "https://gitlab.devops.telekom.de"
    healthEndpoint: false
```

### Check: Latency

Available configuration options:

- `checks`
  - `latency`
    - `enabled` (boolean): Currently not used.
    - `interval` (integer): Interval in seconds to perform the latency check.
    - `timeout` (integer): Timeout in seconds for the latency check.
    - `retry`
      - `count` (integer): Number of retries for the latency check.
      - `delay` (integer): Delay in seconds between retries for the latency check.
    - `targets` (list of strings): List of targets to send latency probe. Needs to be a valid url. Can be another `sparrow` instance. Use latency endpoint, e.g. `https://sparrow-dns.telekom.de/checks/latency`. The remote `sparrow` instance needs the `latencyEndpoint` enabled.
    - `latencyEndpoint` (boolean): Needs to be activated when the `sparrow` should expose its own latency endpoint. Mandatory if another `sparrow` instance wants perform a latency check.
Example configuration:

```yaml
checks:
  latency:
    enabled: true
    interval: 1
    timeout: 3
    retry:
      count: 3
      delay: 1
    targets:
      - https://example.com/
      - https://google.com/
```

### API

The `sparrow` exposes an API that does provide access to the check results. Each check will register its own endpoint at `/v1/metrics/{check-name}`. The API definition will be exposed at `/openapi`
