The `sparrow` is an infrastructure monitoring tool. The binary includes several checks (e.g. health check) that will be
executed periodically.

## About this component

The `sparrow` performs several checks to monitor the health of the infrastructure and network from its point of view.
The following checks are available:

1. [Health check](#check-health) - `health`: The `sparrow` is able to perform an HTTP-based (HTTP/1.1) health check to
   the provided endpoints. The `sparrow` will expose its own health check endpoint as well.

2. [Latency check](#check-latency) - `latency`: The `sparrow` is able to communicate with other `sparrow` instances to
   calculate the time a request takes to the target and back. The check is http (HTTP/1.1) based as well.

3. [DNS check](#check-dns) - `dns`: The `sparrow` is able to perform DNS resolution checks to monitor domain name system
   performance and reliability. The check has the ability to target specific domains or IPs for monitoring.

4. [Traceroute Check](#check-traceroute) - `traceroute`: The `sparrow` is able to perform traceroute checks to monitor
   the network path to a target. The check has the ability to target specific domains or IPs for monitoring.

Each check is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the various aspects of network and service health,
ensuring robust monitoring and quick detection of potential issues.

## Installation

The `sparrow` is provided as a small binary & a container image.

Please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases) to get the latest version.

### Binary

The binary is available for several distributions. To install the binary, use a provided bundle or source.
Replace `${RELEASE_VERSION}` with the desired release version:

```sh
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v${RELEASE_VERSION}/sparrow_${RELEASE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz -Lo sparrow.tar.gz
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v${RELEASE_VERSION}/sparrow_${RELEASE_VERSION}_checksums.txt -Lo checksums.txt
```

For example, for release `v0.3.1`:

```sh
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v0.3.1/sparrow_0.3.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz -Lo sparrow.tar.gz
curl https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases/download/v0.3.1/sparrow_0.3.1_checksums.txt -Lo checksums.txt
```

Extract the binary:

```sh
tar -xf sparrow.tar.gz
```

### Container Image

The [sparrow container images](https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/pkgs/container/sparrow) for
dedicated [release](https://github.com/caas-team/sparrow/releases) can be found in the GitHub registry.

### Helm

Sparrow can be installed via Helm Chart. The chart is available in the GitHub registry:

```sh
helm -n sparrow upgrade -i sparrow oci://ghcr.io/caas-team/charts/sparrow --create-namespace
```

The default settings are suitable for a local configuration. With the default Helm values, the sparrow loader uses a
checks' configuration provided in a ConfigMap (the `file` loader is used). Define the `checksConfig` section to set the
ConfigMap.

Use the following configuration values to use a runtime configuration by the `http` loader:

```yaml
startupConfig:
  ...
  loader:
    type: http
    interval: 30s
    http:
      url: https://url-to-checks-config.de/api/config%2Eyaml

checksConfig: { }
```

To provide the sparrow container with the token, manually create a secret containing the `SPARROW_LOADER_HTTP_TOKEN`
environment variable. Utilize the `envFromSecrets` in the `values.yaml` to enable access to this secret by the sparrow
container. Avoid adding sensitive data like the token used by the `http` loader (`loader.http.token`) directly in the
values section.

The same applies to the target manager token. Use the `SPARROW_TARGETMANAGER_GITLAB_TOKEN` in a secret and bind it with
the `envFromSecrets` in the `values.yaml`.

For all available value options see [Chart README](./chart/README.md).

Additionally check out the sparrow [configuration](#configuration) variants.

## Usage

Use `sparrow run` to execute the instance using the binary. A `sparrowName` (a valid DNS name) is required to be passed,
else the sparrow will not start:

```sh
sparrow run --sparrowName sparrow.telekom.de
```

### Image

Run a `sparrow` container by using e.g. `docker run ghcr.io/caas-team/sparrow`.

Pass the available configuration arguments to the container e.g. `docker run ghcr.io/caas-team/sparrow --help`.

Start the instance using a mounted startup configuration file
e.g. `docker run -v /config:/config  ghcr.io/caas-team/sparrow --config /config/config.yaml`.

## Configuration

The configuration is divided into two parts. The startup configuration and the checks' configuration. The startup
configuration is a technical configuration to configure the `sparrow` instance itself.

### Startup

The available configuration options can be found in the [CLI flag documentation](docs/sparrow.md).

The `sparrow` is able to get the startup configuration from different sources as follows.

Priority of configuration (high to low):

1. CLI flags
2. Environment variables
3. Defined configuration file
4. Default configuration file

Every value in the config file can be set through environment variables.

You can set a token for the http loader:

```bash
export SPARROW_LOADER_HTTP_TOKEN="xxxxxx"
```

Or for any other config attribute:

```bash
export SPARROW_ANY_OTHER_OPTION="Some value"
```

Just write out the path to the attribute, delimited by `_`.

#### Example Startup Configuration

```

#### Loader

The loader component of the `sparrow` dynamically loads the [checks](#checks)' configuration during runtime.

You select which loader is used by setting the `loaderType` parameter.

Available loaders:

- `http` (default): Retrieves the checks' configuration from a remote endpoint during runtime. Additional configuration
  parameters are set in the `loader.http` section.

- `file`: Loads the checks' configuration from a local file during runtime. Additional configuration
  parameters are set in the `loader.file` section.

If you want to retrieve the checks' configuration only once, you can set `loader.interval` to 0.
The target manager is currently not functional in combination with this configuration.

#### Logging Configuration

You can configure the logging behavior of the sparrow instance by setting the following environment variables:

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Adjusts the minimum log level.
  Available options: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.
- `LOG_FORMAT`: Sets the log format. This allows you to customize the format of the log messages.
  Available options: `JSON`, `TEXT`.

### Checks

In addition to the technical startup configuration, the `sparrow` checks' configuration can be dynamically loaded during runtime.
The `loader` is capable of dynamically loading and configuring checks.

For detailed information on available loader configuration options, please refer
to [this documentation](docs/sparrow_run.md).

Example format of a configuration file for the checks:

```YAML
health:
  targets: [ ]
```

### Target Manager

The `sparrow` can optionally manage targets for checks and register itself as a target on a (remote) backend through
the `TargetManager` interface. This feature is optional; if the startup configuration does not include
the `targetManager`, it will not be used. When configured, it offers various settings, detailed below, which can be set
in the startup YAML configuration file as shown in the [example configuration](#example-startup-configuration).

| Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| `targetManager.type`                 | Type of the target manager. Options: `gitlab`                                                                                                   |
| `targetManager.checkInterval`        | Interval for checking new targets.                                                                                                              |
| `targetManager.unhealthyThreshold`   | Threshold for marking a target as unhealthy. 0 means no cleanup.                                                                                |
| `targetManager.registrationInterval` | Interval for registering the current sparrow at the target backend. 0 means no registration.                                                    |
| `targetManager.updateInterval`       | Interval for updating the registration of the current sparrow. 0 means no update.                                                               |
| `targetManager.gitlab.baseUrl`       | Base URL of the GitLab instance.                                                                                                                |
| `targetManager.gitlab.token`         | Token for authenticating with the GitLab instance.                                                                                              |
| `targetManager.gitlab.projectId`     | Project ID for the GitLab project used as a remote state backend.                                                                               |
| `targetManager.scheme`               | Should the target register itself as http or https. Can be `http` or `https`. This needs to be set to `https`, when `api.tls.enabled` == `true` |

Currently, only one target manager exists: the Gitlab target manager. It uses a gitlab project as the remote state
backend. The various `sparrow` instances can register themselves as targets in the project.
The `sparrow` instances will also check the project for new targets and add them to the local state.
The registration is done by committing a "state" file in the main branch of the repository,
which is named after the DNS name of the `sparrow`. The state file contains the following information:

```json
{
  "url": "<SCHEME>://<SPARROW_DNS_NAME>",
  "lastSeen": "2021-09-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Check: Traceroute

| Field            | Type              | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `interval`       | `duration`        | Interval to perform the Traceroute check.                                    |
| `timeout`        | `duration`        | Timeout for every hop.                                                       |
| `retries`        | `integer`         | Number of times to retry the traceroute for a target, if it fails.           |
| `maxHops`        | `integer`         | Maximum number of hops to try before giving up.                              |
| `targets`        | `list of objects` | List of targets to traceroute to.                                            |
| `targets[].addr` | `string`          | The address of the target to traceroute to. Can be an IP address or DNS name |
| `targets[].port` | `uint16`          | The port of the target to traceroute to. Default is 80                       |

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->
#### Example configuration
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD024 -->

```yaml
 traceroute:
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 3s
  retries: 3
  maxHops: 8
  targets:
    - addr: 8.8.8.8
      port: 53
    - addr: www.google.com
      port: 80
```

#### Required Capabilities

To use this check, sparrow needs to be run with the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability or elevated privileges to be able to send raw packets.
Using the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability is recommended over running sparrow as sudo.

```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw=ep' sparrow
```

## API

The `sparrow` exposes an API for accessing the results of various checks. Each check registers its own endpoint
at `/v1/metrics/{check-name}`. The API's definition is available at `/openapi`.

## Metrics

The `sparrow` provides a `/metrics` endpoint to expose application metrics. In addition to runtime information, the sparrow provides specific metrics for each check. Refer to the [Checks](#checks) section for more detailed information.

### Prometheus Integration

The `sparrow` metrics API is designed to be compatible with Prometheus. To integrate `sparrow` with Prometheus, add the following scrape configuration to your Prometheus configuration file:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'sparrow'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<sparrow_instance_address>:8080']
```

Replace `<sparrow_instance_address>` with the actual address of your `sparrow` instance.

### Traces

The `sparrow` supports exporting telemetry data using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). This allows users to choose their preferred telemetry provider and collector. The following configuration options are available for setting up telemetry:

| Field      | Type     | Description                                                              |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `exporter` | `string` | The telemetry exporter to use. Options: `grpc`, `http`, `stdout`, `noop` |
| `url`      | `string` | The address to export telemetry to                                       |
| `token`    | `string` | The token to use for authentication                                      |
| `certPath` | `string` | The path to the TLS certificate to use                                   |

For example, to export telemetry data using OTLP via gRPC, you can add the following configuration to your [startup configuration](#startup):

```yaml
telemetry:
  # The telemetry exporter to use.
  # Options:
  # grpc: Exports telemetry using OTLP via gRPC.
  # http: Exports telemetry using OTLP via HTTP.
  # stdout: Prints telemetry to stdout.
  # noop | "": Disables telemetry.
  exporter: grpc
  # The address to export telemetry to.
  url: collector.example.com:4317
  # The token to use for authentication.
  # If the exporter does not require a token, this can be left empty.
  token: ""
  # The path to the tls certificate to use.
  # To disable tls, either set this to an empty string or set it to insecure.
  certPath: ""
```

Since [OTLP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/) is a standard protocol, you can choose any collector that supports it. The `stdout` exporter can be used for debugging purposes to print telemetry data to the console, while the `noop` exporter disables telemetry. If an external collector is used, a bearer token for authentication and a TLS certificate path for secure communication can be provided.
